<h1> Hooray for my first project! </h1>

This is the first code I ever pieced together. Thanks to a little bit of wondering cluelessly through a self guided tutorial.. 
woomp woomp woomp, I had no idea what the heck was happening other than there were numbers and those numbers where doing something. BAHAHAH

I think it's so important for me to note this though. It's truly amazing how far I have come since that day.
This project was the start of it all. I became the budding developer that I am today because I played around with this silly little clock.
